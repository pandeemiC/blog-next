# BlogNext - A Blogging Platform Project

BlogNext, a project that's a full-stack blogging application built to explore modern web development practices with Next.js and Sanity.io.

## Project Overview

BlogNext is designed as a platform for users to read, search, and (for authenticated users) eventually create blog content. The primary goal for the project is to get a hands on learning experience with common Next.js, CMS anderror monitoring practices.

## Core Features

- **Blog Post Display:** Renders blog posts fetched from a headless CMS.
- **Content Search:** Users can search for blog posts by title, category, author, and content description, which the search functionality is case-insensitive.
- **User Authentication:** Implements GitHub OAuth for user login via NextAuth.js.
- **Author Integration:** Associates blog posts with authors, displaying author information,avatars and their descriptions.
- **Markdown Support:** Blog content is intended to be written in Markdown and is styled using Tailwind CSS Typography for a clean reading experience.
- **Responsive Design:** Styled with Tailwind CSS for adaptability across different screen sizes.
- **Experimental Next.js Features:** The project is configured to use Next.js 15 (Canary) with Turbopack and has support for experimental Partial Prerendering (PPR).
- **Error Tracking:** Utilizes Sentry.io for real-time error reporting and performance monitoring.
